node_modules  # Excludes the node_modules directory, which typically contains installed npm packages. No need to include it in the Docker image as dependencies are installed during the build process.

dist  # Excludes the dist directory, which may contain production build artifacts. It's often generated by build tools like webpack or TypeScript.

Dockerfile  # Excludes the Dockerfile itself from being included in the Docker image. The Dockerfile is used only for building the image and is not needed in the final container.

docker-compose.yml  # Excludes the docker-compose.yml file from being included in the Docker image. This file is used for defining services, networks, and volumes for Docker containers, and it's not required inside the container.

.git  # Excludes the .git directory, which contains version control information (e.g., Git repository). It's unnecessary to include this in the Docker image.

.gitignore  # Excludes the .gitignore file, which specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git. It's not needed inside the Docker image.

.vscode  # Excludes the .vscode directory, which typically contains Visual Studio Code settings. These settings are specific to the development environment and are not needed in the Docker image.
